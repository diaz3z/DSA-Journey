    "**Abstraction** is defined as a process of hiding the implementation details of a system from the user. Thus, by using abstraction, we provided only the functionality of the system to the user. Consequently, the user will have information on what the system does, but not on how the system does it.\n",

    "2. Encapsulation focuses on bundling data and methods within a class, restricting direct access to the internal state of an object. It ensures data protection and enables controlled access to the object's attributes."

    "### Constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a constructor is **a special method used to initialize the attributes (state) of an object when it is created from a class**. The specific method for this is `__init__()`, which is automatically called every time a new instance of the class is made. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`__init__` method:** This is the primary method used as a constructor. It takes `self` as the first mandatory parameter, which is a reference to the newly created instance itself, allowing you to set that specific object's properties.\n",
    "- **Automatic Invocation:** You do not call the `__init__` method directly. It is automatically triggered when you create an object (e.g., `my_object = MyClass(\"value\")`).\n",
    "- **Purpose:** The main task is to assign initial values to instance variables, ensuring that the object starts in a consistent and valid state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Constructors**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python typically distinguishes between two types based on whether they accept arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Default Constructor:** If you don't define an `__init__` method in your class, Python provides a default one automatically that does nothing beyond basic object creation.\n",
    "- **Non-Parameterized Constructor:** A constructor you define that takes no arguments other than `self`.\n",
